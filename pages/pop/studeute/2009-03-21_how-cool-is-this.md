My house was built in 1929. The same family (mother, father, son) lived in it from the late 30’s until 2001.

Just by accident, I met the son a few years ago. Great guy. He gave me tons of pictures of the house over the years and even the original paperwork when his parents purchased it ($20 a month for 10 years).

These pictures were in those he gave me. It’s him and his “new” custom he had just purchased in California. It was 1958…

I was out cruising the Ute today and couldn’t resist taking a few in a similar spot…

Both are 53’s, both were customized in ‘58, and both have “lived” at the same house…only 50 years apart! 😎
