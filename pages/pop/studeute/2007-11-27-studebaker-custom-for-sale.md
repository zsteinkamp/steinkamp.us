I cruise _Craig’s List_ fairly frequently.  Last night I saw a minor ad (no pictures) for a 1953 Studebaker Custom.  Advertised as being in the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show and reported to have been done by George Barris.

I’m a sucker for an outing to see a “different” Studebaker and this one was close…Anacortes.  I took Jon along to help evaluate the car.  This is what we saw…

It was actually attractive.  Fairly straight, no rust.  Real ugly wheels, tires and stance.  The guy wanted $9k for it with a worn out Chevy V8 and a 6 speed he intended to install in it.  I told him I’d think about it.
