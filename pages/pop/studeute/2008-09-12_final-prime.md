We put the ute in final primer yesterday. Another week or so of sanding and we should be ready for finish paint.

This car is going to be SOOOO straightâ€¦I shoulda painted it black ðŸ˜‰

Iâ€™ve had a change of heart on the engine color. Now leaning towards Oldsmobile Gold. The Kart will still be red.
