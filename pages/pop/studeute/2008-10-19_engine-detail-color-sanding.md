Pekka got me motivated to get the ‘55 President V8 detailed for installation. Gord Richmond built this motor.

I couldn’t help kind of setting it together. The carbs are old ones (the ones going on it are apart at this point). The oil pan will be replaced with a later style one I have that is also freshly gold painted. The intake needs to be shined up a little. I love the old skool Edmunds air cleaners 😝.

The car is at that stage where the shiny, as shot paint, has been sanded (1500) and looks like H E double hockey sticks 😤. I will go over it again with 2000, then buff…

Making progress on assembling the chassis. With a few minor exceptions, it is essentially done…
