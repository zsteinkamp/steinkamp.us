I donâ€™t check the Studebaker Swap Page as often as I should. BAMS emailed me with a car posted there that he thought Iâ€™d be interested in. Iâ€™m over inventoried right now, but I checked it out anyway. Right above the ad for that car was some vintage engine dress up parts. I bought Offenhauser valve covers, a finned valley cover, and a chromed oil filler stack from that ad.

_A premonition..._

These will go on the Uteâ€™s â€˜55 President motor (thanks Gord!) along with the aluminum 2 x 2 intake with backdraft Stromberg WWâ€™s.

2009 will be the 50th anniversary of the Uteâ€™s appearance in the National Roadster Show (Oakland Roadster Show). The show is now in Pomona and called the Grand National Roadster Show. I am lobbying to get the Ute into that show this coming February. Good incentive to get it done! ðŸ˜Ž
