title: Kart For the Ute

The Ute is looking less and less like a vehicle ☹️. It always gets worse before it gets better, but it is currently torn down to nothing. 😬. Pretty much just the body on the chassis sans doors, fenders, etc. as various body pieces get prepped for first primer. I’ll post some pics later.

In the meantime, I have been hunting for the right Kart to display in the bed of the Ute at the GNRS as was done 50 years ago at the Oakland Roadster Show.

I found it and bought it today…

It’s a Dart “A-bone” with two West Bend 820’s. Race ready.

I’ll probably end up blowing it apart and painting the chassis the same color as the Ute (WHATEVER that turns out to be 😃)

The downsides are…

They aren’t $125 any more like they were back in ‘59 ☹️. It’s tough for a CASO to pay more for a Go Kart than I pay for most Studebakers 🤨

Also, I’m liable to get hooked on vintage Kart racing 👍. That’s ALL I need…one more hobby 😤
