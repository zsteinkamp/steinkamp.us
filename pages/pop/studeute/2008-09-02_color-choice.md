I’ve chosen the color for the ute. Art’s (and Brian Curtis’) LEAST favorite color of those in the running is seafoam green. That’s what I’ve picked. Sorry Art and Brian ☺️.

Actually it is 1953 Studebaker Chippewa Green. Same as the lower color on Jeff H’s beautiful ‘53…

The interior will be cream and the Chippewa Green vinyl done in a 50’s style.

I know the seafoam green got other thumbs down and that it is not EVERYBODY’S favorite, but it just kept coming back to me. I think it will be beautiful on the ute (and that’s what count’s the most 👍)

BTW, it was one of Lee Talbot’s (original builder of the ute in 1958) favorites when I discussed color choices with him over lunch a month or so ago.
