The highpoint of the day was Andy’s visit. Great to meet forum members in person 👍…and Andy brought donuts to boot! 😄. Andy cruised down from San Francisco in his beautiful GT with an awesome family history. A VERY special car 😎.

Later in the day, my son and I loaded the Ute for the ride to the GNRS. Deb and I leave tomorrow for San Luis Obispo and our youngest daughter’s place for a few days.
