I got some chrome back from Jerry Forrester today…

It is frickin PERFECT. If you looked up “show chrome” in the dictionary, Jerry’s work would be there. 😝

I also received the following from the GNRS along with a note that they have ripped up my check for the entry fees…

> Dear Twice in a Lifetime invitee,
>

Twice in a Lifetime will take us all back in history to the classic roadster show with a recreation of the old GNRS buildings highlighted by vehicles from the 1950s to the 2000s.
>

You will receive Show credentials (2 set up day passes, 2 three day passes, and a weekend parking pass and the show gift package), a commemorative commissioned Dave Bell 60th anniversary poster, and a one of a kind Suede Jacket with the 60th Anniversary Logo embroidered on the back (see logo above) and your name and the first year in the GNRS embroidered on it.

Yea…I’m stoked 😄
