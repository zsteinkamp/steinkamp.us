I also received the following from the GNRS along with a note that they have ripped up my check for the entry fees‚Ä¶

Dear Twice in a Lifetime invitee,**_

Your vehicle has been specially chosen to join an elite gathering of vehicles celebrating the 60th Anniversary of the Grand National Roadster Show. Twice in a Lifetime will take us all back in history to the classic roadster show with a recreation of the old GNRS buildings highlighted by vehicles from the 1950s to the 2000s.

We will showcase award winning hot rods, customs, bikes, trucks and classics that will offer a unique look at the transition of show vehicle trends over the decades. We think your vehicle best represents the look and style that we want to showcase at this years Grand National Roadster Show.
