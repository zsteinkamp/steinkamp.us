title: Crate deal from Gord
date: July 26th, 2008

Gord shipped me the T86 OD with top shifter that he built for the Ute. It arrived yesterday at the DHL terminal in Abbotsford, BC…about 15 miles from my house. Saves a bunch of customs paperwork and expense to just go get it and declare it coming back to the US.

The crate is a work of art! 😝…but to be expected from Gord 👍…

Check the rubber tube covered rope handles 😬

It is nicer than the coffee table in my house, so Jon and I thought we should use it as such at the “clubhouse”…

Inside was the T86 and parts…all very carefully packed and secured. I think this package would have made it to Mars with no damage 😎…

Thanks, Gord!! 😄
