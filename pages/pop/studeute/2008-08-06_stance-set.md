I’ve been agonizing over how the Ute should “sit” almost as much as which color to paint it. 

Here’s the final, final, final tires, wheels and stance…

G78 15’s with 2 3/4″ white walls. ‘55 Plymouth caps. Stock 5″ Stude wheels in front. 6″ with 1/2″ less backspacing MoPar wheels in back. 

It sits 2″ lower in front (bottom of the rear of the front wheel well, to the bottom of the front of the rear wheel well)
