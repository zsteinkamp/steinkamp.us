I just had Jerry Forrester redo the chrome on the grill surrounds and tail light bodies of the Ute. The tail light bodies had some major dents and dings. The grill surrounds were distorted and dull. The pieces were not only done quickly by Jerry, but is the best chrome plate I have ever seen (I’ve seen A LOT, and I’m super fussy). They look much better than Studebaker ever even THOUGHT of doing. The model of show chrome. I’ve had a lot of chrome done by various shops and Jerry beats them all…by far!

Anybody looking for perfection, contact Jerry (goes by Jerry Forrester here on the forum). You won’t go wrong.
