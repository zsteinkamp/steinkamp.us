**I’m stoked** 😝 😎 😄

Just received this from the Producer of the Grand National Roadster Show…

> Hi Dick,

**(did I say I was stoked? !!)** 😎😬😝😄

Jon Falcon has agreed to do the body and paint for me. He’s my young buddy and WyoTech grad that has about 4 years in a restoration shop and did the ‘63 Hawk for me last year. He’s now at Western Washington University here in Bellingham in their Industrial Design program, but has the summer off.

It will have a ‘55 President 259 with 2 backdraft Stromberg 2 barrels and some Offenhauser aluminum dress up stuff. 3 speed OD with a Jeep floor shifter. (engine and trans courtesy of Gord Richmond)

I need a vintage go Kart for the bed as it was exhibited at the ‘59 ORS.

It was Pink at the ‘59 ORS, but I can’t do pink. Need some color suggestions.

**I’m stoked!**
