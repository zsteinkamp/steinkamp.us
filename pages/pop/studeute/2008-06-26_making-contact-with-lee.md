I’m in California doing a little beach sitting and other unproductive activities 😉.

I checked my voice mail at my home phone yesterday and there was a message from Chris Talbot. Chris explained that his father, Lee Talbot, and his partner Sam Chakries are the ones that originally built the Ute for the ‘59 Oakland Roadster Show.

I called Chris back. He explained that they had seen the article in Hot Rod Deluxe on the car and that his Dad is STOKED that his old custom has surfaced. He gave me his Dad’s phone number. Lee is 80 and lives in Astoria, OR.

I gave Lee a call today. What a great guy! Sharp as a tack. A real car guy through and through. He has built many cars and recently repurchased the 28 Ford hot rod he owned when he was in the army 55 years ago!

Lee has pictures of the Ute when it was under construction and some at the ORS. We will meet in Olympia, WA mid July so I can get copies of all the pictures and hear all the stories.

Lee is super excited that the car will be in the Grand National Roadster Show for the 50th anniversary of its appearance in the predecessor of that show.

He told me that Sam Chakries still lives in Livermore and would also be excited to talk with me.

Neat deal 😎

Also this trip I stopped in to see Howdy Ledbetter. Howdy did the interior on my black Starliner. Howdy is a Hot Rod Hall of Fame member and has done the interiors on many high profile hot rods and customs. He did the interior on the restoration of Ala Kart, for example. Howdy is a talented, friendly, down to earth guy that just loves cars. He’s agreed to do the Ute. It will be beautiful! 😝
