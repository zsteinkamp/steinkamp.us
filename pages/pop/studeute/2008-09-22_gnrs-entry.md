I just received the Uteâ€™s official invitation to the Grand National Roadster Show. Included are some of the things to do that separate the winners from the losers.

> * Are the tires indexed correctly on the wheel and aligned so that the valve stems are placed at bottom as the vehicles rests on the ground?
> 
> * Are the tire nibs removed and the tread dressed so you see no factory blemishes?
> 
> * Is the wiring loomed with wire ties spaced one inch apart?
> 
> * Are all the fasteners lined up (clocked) and are they of the same type?
> 
> * Can the judging team touch any part of the vehicle with white gloves and not find any dirt or grease or sooty exhaust?

â€¦and on and on.

I donâ€™t think going this far is my cup of tea, but it will be a blast being there with the Studebaker even though there might be some soot in the exhaust pipes ðŸ˜¬.
