The Ute got color yesterday.  It went to the paint booth Friday evening and we painted it Saturday.  About 12 hours in the booth (we’re slow <grin>).

Here it is set up in the booth…

Here’s a short video of the first color on the left rear quarter…

The color is a lot more “minty” in the pictures than in person.  Might be all the florescent lights in the booth.  I’ll try to get some pics in the natural light when I bring it home today.
