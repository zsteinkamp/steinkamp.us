I was working on our coffee table replacement over the
weekend and needed to taper some 3x3 legs I had
laminated from 1x3.5 stock earlier in the day.

Previously I had used a home made jig I put together
around six months ago.  It was flimsy and inaccurate,
but it was all I had.

On the way back from <a
href=http://www.southernlumber.com/>Southern
Lumber</a>, i had an idea... I could use the "Shop
Stop" on my <a href=http://www.incra.biz/Products/miter1000se.html>Incra Miter 1000 SE</a> to hold a piece
securely for a good taper.  Since the miter gauge goes
all the way to 95 degrees in each direction, I could
do any sort of taper.

Check the photos above for how it looks in action.

The only limitation I can see is in the width of the
piece it can cut, since it's limited to how far the
gauge can adjust within the saw's miter slots.
