I've started a new blog to chronicle the birth and life of a little racecar that Derek and I are building.  It's called "<a href='http://specthismiata.com/'>spec.this.miata " (http://specthismiata.com/)</a>.  We're building a Spec Miata, which is basically a Miata with a hardtop, rollcage, and improved suspension.

We'll update the blog whenever we do something to or with the car.  It's on track to go to <a href='http://tcdesignfab.com/'>TC Design</a> on January 8 so that Tony can fabricate a roll cage and seat brackets.

I'm signed up to go to <a href='http://www.ggcbmwcca.org/index.php?module=calendar&calendar[view]=event&id=211'>Laguna Seca on January 22 with BMWCCA</a>, where I hope to be driving the Miata!
