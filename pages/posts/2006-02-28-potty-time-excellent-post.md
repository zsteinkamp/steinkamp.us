      most babies around the world are potty trained by the time they are a year old.  We
      decided we would get Marina on the track to becoming Diaper Free...

<img align='right' src='/images/marina_diaper_free.jpg' alt='Marina on her potty.' style='border:1px solid black'>Zack and I decided early on that when Marina could
walk and communicate, she should also be potty
trained. We couldn't see ourselves changing the diaper
of a two year old after being instructed by her to do
so. Hence, our potty journey began. 

I had talked with my mom about how she potty trained
my brother and I. She told me she would hold us over
the toilet when she thought we had to go and by the
time we were about a year old, we would take ourselves
to the bathroom. Simple as that. 

When Marina was a few
weeks old, Mimi sent me a New York Times Article about
infant potty training. I think she sent it as a joke!
The article suggested that the reader check out the
website <a href='http://www.diaperfreebaby.org'>www.diaperfreebaby.org</a> for more information.
After exploring the website I found a local group that
I joined. I lurked on the list for many weeks, not
quite sure how, when, or if we would ever start. 

I decided that we needed a potty chair. Everyone on
the list seemed to prefer the Baby Bjorn Little Potty
(aka BBLP) so that's what I got. That sat around
unused for several weeks. I also decided to purchase a
potty turtleneck that some people on the list talked
about. A potty turtleneck is a nifty little accessory (like a toilet seat cozy) that takes the chill out of the BBLP. The turtleneck
was made by some nice ladies at <a href='http://theecstore.com/'>The EC Store</a>. "EC"
stands for elimination communication - another name
for infant potty training. 

I spent many weeks thinking about how in the world we
were going to get Marina to pee or poo on her potty.
It seemed impossible. I asked my mom again how she did
it and what I should do to start. She told me to put
Marina on the potty every time I changed her diaper
and just see what happens. She also said that I
wouldn't make a catch every time but it was a good
start. My immediate reply was, "If I'm changing her
diaper, she obviously doesn't have to go to the
bathroom because she just went!" My mom told me to
just do it. So I left it at that. 

A few more weeks went by. I read this book called
Diaper Free by <a href='http://www.natural-wisdom.com/'>Ingrid Bauer</a>. It was interesting but it
still didn't make sense to me. I wanted to have it all
figured out before i tried it. 

The next thing I did was to move the BBLP into
Marina's room. I thought maybe if it was near the area
where we change her, i might put her on it. It sat in
her room for a couple of weeks. 

Finally, on the night of December 30, I had a
revelation. I was going to do it! The time had come. I
was changing Marina's diaper. Before I put on the new
one, I set her on the BBLP and made the cueing sound,
"Psss, psss, psss." Viola! She immediately pooped! I
was thrilled! I felt so proud of her and myself!

Little did we know, but our life was about to
become even more focused on poo and pee. We continued
on, putting Marina on her potty after naps and
whenever we thought she might have to go. At first we
didn't catch much, so I began keeping track of the
intervals at which Marina peed and pooped. I also
looked for signals she would give when she had to go, such as certain fussy noises.

After many misses, I came up with a pretty good
system. Now, on most days we catch 75-80% of the pees
and 100% of the poops. 

Zack and I are very happy that we are potty training
Marina. We wouldn't have it any other way. It seems so much more hygenic to take a baby to the bathroom when it's time to pee or poo. 

Babies don't just fuss or cry for no reason - they're trying to tell you something!
