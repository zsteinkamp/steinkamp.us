    excerpt: I set out today to tackle Rose Peak once again.  I hiked it a couple
      years ago, but haven't done it since I've been running.  It behooves me to practice
      it, since it's 1/3 of the Ohlone 50K.  Strava's calorie count is my favorite
      part! (om nom nom)

I set out today to tackle Rose Peak once again.  I hiked it a couple years ago, but haven't done it since I've been running.  It behooves me to practice it, since it's 1/3 of the Ohlone 50K.

I set out at 9am (dang it DST!) and got to the peak in 2h30m.  Took only a little less time to get back to the parking lot.  Compared with the last time, I knocked 3 hours off my personal best (har!).

Loving Strava's calorie counter (5165kcal)...

Here's a 360 degree view from the top of Rose Peak...

It doesn't show up in the pano, but I could see the Sierras from the summit there.  Super clear day!

Bring the 50K!
