Today we released a big upgrade to Dipity on Facebook.

Previously, you could look at your Facebook Photos and Facebook Events and see a visualization of how you "connected" with your friends through these objects.  It was a read-only experience.

With the current release, we've taken a fundamental step forward.  You can now create your own Dipity events.  You can put these events on not only your own personal timeline, but on your friends' timelines too!

We see timelines as storytelling devices -- whether you're telling your own life story, chronicling historical events, or building a fantasy world.  By adding a layer of interactivity (sliding, zooming, and adding multimedia), we've taken timelines from something you likely remember from History class into compelling mechanism for consuming any kind of information.

The <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/_dipity_/index.php">Dipity app homepage</a> now shows you a selection of friends who have installed, and who have not yet installed Dipity.  There's also a form to add an event to your timeline.

From the homepage, you can view your own timeline, view a friend's timeline, or compare a set of friends to see when they have done things together.

When you add something to a friend's timeline, they get a notification (usually an email) that you did this, and will likely want to
 visit Dipity to see what you wrote, and hopefully to put something on your timeline in return.

On the profile page, we now push items to your minifeed when you add Dipity events, provide an action item under your profile image, provide a profile page box with a snapshot of the most recently added events to your timeline, and a event quick-add form.

Here are some screenshots so you can see what this is all about:

<div style="clear:both;"></div>
We have now entered the world of content creation.  This is just the beginning though ... we will have several new features in the coming weeks to help people build and discover the Serendipity in their lives!
