  The RSS feeds for stories and pictures are now rolled into a single feed.  It

Today, I wrote a little bit of code to combine stories, photos, and videos into a single RSS feed.

Previously, there was a feed for stories and a feed for pictures. With Marina, driving events, the DV Cam, our Macs, and iMovie HD, we've been making and sharing lots of videos. I thought about making a feed just for videos, but that seemed like a worse solution than just rolling a single feed.

So from now going forward, there is just a single feed from the Nobot. The old photos feed will still work for a long while, but you only need to subscribe to:

Ok, that's all for me. Back to the fun...
