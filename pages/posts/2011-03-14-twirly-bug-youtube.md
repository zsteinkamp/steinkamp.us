    title: Twirly Bug
    description: This legendary reddish-brown critter thrives in our vegetable garden.  It&#39;s
      motionless until you give it a gentle squeeze, then it twirls one part this
      way and that.  Is it for digging or for tickling a predator&#39;s throat?  And
      what is it exactly?
