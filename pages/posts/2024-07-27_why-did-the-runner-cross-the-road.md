  A little post giving my $0.02 on what side of the road a runner should run on.

## tl;dr

Where visibility is good, run on the left side. If you're approaching a blind left turn or approaching a crest, run on the right side. No matter what, use your good judgment to analyze the nuance of the situation at hand to make the best decision.

## Background

I'm mostly a trail runner. The biggest dangers on a trail are snakes, twisted ankles, mountain lions, and mountain bikers. These things can be real problems but are minor compared with the dangers we face running on roads.

Out on the asphalt rivers, we have to contend with multi-ton behemouths whizzing by 20-40mph faster than us, piloted by people with varying skills and attention levels. Any coming together spells quick death or serious injury to the runner, and _maybe_ a trip to the body shop for the vehicle.

I commuted by bike for several years, and was really surprised to observe that a LOT of drivers are looking at their phones while they are driving. It seemed that fully 1/3 of people would drive with a phone in their hand, spending more time looking at the screen than at what was happening around them. This really taught me to be weary of other drivers and _never_ assume they are paying attention.

Most road running has the luxury of sidewalks or some kind of separation from the danger of cars. However, there are several places I run where there are no sidewalks, hence this article.

## Mostly Run on the Left

In most cases, run on the left edge of the road. There is a simple reason for this -- by being able to see a car barreling down on you, whose driver is possibly not paying attention, you at least have a chance to get out of the way. If you were running on the right side, then the car would be coming up behind you. You could hear it, but they may not be paying attention, and are you really going to look over your shoulder any time you hear a car?

Optimize for mutual perception. If at least one party perceives the other, at least there is a chance to do something in an imminent collision.

## In Left Turns, Run on the Right

Imagine you are driving a car on a twisty road. A blind right turn approaches. How much do you slow down? Do you think you could stop in 10 feet or less? Probably not. If we runners blindly run on the left side when going around left bends, then we put ourselves in grave danger. Drivers tend to hug the inside of turns, which is where your delicate self would be if you stayed on your left.

This is why, as runners, we should run on our right side when the road bends left. This does put oncoming traffic behind you, but at least you are visible to the driver.

Of course, be careful when transitioning from the left to the right side, and from right to left after the turn.

## When Approaching a Blind Crest, Run on the Right

Similar to the advice above about left turns, imagine what a driver sees when approaching a blind crest. If you're running on the left (against traffic), the driver who is driving toward you cannot see you -- you are on the other side of the crest. If they are distracted and drift to the right as both of you are approaching the crest, there's a possible life-changing collision possible. By transitioning to the right side as you approach the hill, you give yourself the best chance of being seen by drivers who are also approaching the crest on your side.

At the top of the crest, transition back to the left for the same reasons.

## Regardless, Always Use Your Brain and Senses

Of course, the real world is full of nuance and exceptions. Use all of your senses and your smart brain to make the best decision for the moment. Find the right balance between your ability to see oncoming traffic, and that traffic's ability to see you.

Ears can be incredibly useful senses for knowing what is going on around you. Headphones can change this for the worse.

Be safe out there so you can keep runnin'!!!
