The place where I make music and do other creative things is constantly evolving. There are so many ways that a workspace can be set up, and that setup affects what happens in that workspace.

Highlights of the current setup:

- IKEA GALANT frame/legs on risers (standing height)
- Adjustable footrest
- Amazon whatever top attached to the frame
- Tall office chair with arms and back removed so it's more of a stool. Sit/stand but desk stays same.
- Stacked dual 34" 4k60 monitors
  - Ableton dual windows
  - Top is arrangement only
  - Bottom is mixer, clips, chains, VSTs
- Push 2 above audio interface
- Elgato Stream Deck
  - Macros and dedicated buttons for Ableton Live, e.g.
    - Consolidate and loop
    - New tracks
    - Show plugins / chains / clips
    - Zoom lane vertically
    - Zoom to height+width
    - Stop
    - Record
- iPad running [Knobbler3](https://github.com/zsteinkamp/m4l-zs-Knobbler3), my free, open-source, auto-labeling Live parameter control surface
  - Lets you map any parameter in the set to a slider on the iPad with a single touch
  - Use this as a performance device with multitouch and multiple pages of sliders.
  - Values, colors, track name, device name, parameter name are updated on the iPad to match the Live Set
  - It's Free!
- Custom made from recycled IKEA furniture boards / planks (usually particle board with melamine coating in metric sizes!):
  - MacBook sits vertically in a wooden pocket on the side of the desk with ports exposed. Protip: Put some foam in the bottom of the pocket to cushion your MBP's landing.
  - Wooden cable shelf underneath the rear of the desktop

    I'm sure it will be different next week!
