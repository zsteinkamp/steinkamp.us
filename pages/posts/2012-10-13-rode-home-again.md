  Second time riding home from work.  It took 30 minutes less today, despite
  taking a bit longer route.  This is mostly due to not taking wrong turns and
  having to backtrack ;-).

The light was really cool while I was out by the bay. The sky was mostly dark, but there were patches where the sun was shining through.
