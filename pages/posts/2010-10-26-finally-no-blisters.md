I gave my Asolo TPS 520 a lot of chances to do well.  Great reviews on Zappos, designed in the Italian Alps, how could they not be awesome?  Well after 50 miles and sore, blistered feet I knew how.

Zappos let me return them for a full refund, even though they were in very much less than new condition.

My resolution was to find a great hiking shoe that was waterproof, could handle going "off trail" and that was, more than anything, comfortable.

I work in Palo Alto on California Avenue.  The best coffee in Palo alto is just down the street from my office and is made by Don Lundell, the co-owner of <a href="http://www.zombierunner.com/about/palo_alto_store/">Zombie Runner</a>.  Apparently, they also are crazy for carrying the best possible equipment for people who run and hike.

I ended up with a pair of Salomon XA Pro 3D Mid GTX boots from there.  From the moment I tried them on, I knew they were it.  Exceptionally friendly and knowledgable sales staff.  Thumbs up for Zombie Runner!

Anyhow, I took a walk in them this past weekend.  Fantastic!  8 miles and hardly a pain from my poor toes.  Off trail, up slippery grass, over rocks -- perfect.  Here is a map of a portion of my route.  The app I use to record the walks went haywire halfway through and didn't capture my route back, which was on the Agua Caliente trail -- the first time I'd taken it.
