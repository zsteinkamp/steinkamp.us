Simulscrub is an instrument that is something like a sampler and something like a Granulator, but very different than both.

It is a sample player that has some number of playheads spread evenly across the sample, each one playing its own section of the sample, all simultaneously. To keep it from just being a cacophony, a virtual microphone can be moved across the playheads, so that only certain segments are actually audible. This allows you to scrub in high or low speed, forward or backward in time through your sample, but it is always playing at 1x speed.

A minimal intro to the device:

Here it is, using a 60 minute recording of a performance of "In C" as its sample and as one of the most important instruments in the composition:
