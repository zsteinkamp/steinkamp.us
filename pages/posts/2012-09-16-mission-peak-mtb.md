  Rode up Mission Peak today with Sean Kohler.  I was expecting it to be
  harder than it was, but it was still a doozie.  We did about 10 miles total,
  2700 feet elevation gain.  The first stretch up the peak was 2.8 miles and 1750
  feet gain -- unrelentingly steep.  From there we went around the back of the
  peak and up to Mt. Allison, then came back and went down the Grove Trail past
  the farmhouse (sweet technical section!) and rejoined the main trail.  I'm really
  happy we did it!
