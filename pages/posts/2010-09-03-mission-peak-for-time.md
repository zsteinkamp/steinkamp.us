I went up everyone's favorite east bay peak this morning to see just how quickly I could do it.  Going from the Stanford Ave parking lot up the Peak Trail is just under 3 miles and the elevation gain is just over 2,000 feet.  My goal was to do this in an hour, but I finished it in 1:04:20 without cutting any swithbacks or taking other shortcuts.  Close enough where next time I think I can do it.

I came down the south side of the peak and crossed over at Hidden Valley back to the Peak Trail.  Map is below...
