With the [Ohlone 50k](http://ohlone50k.com) looming in May, I've been inspired to get back out there on foot on the trails. After a few weeks away, this weekend was the time to get back into it.

My initial plan was to follow the O50K course up and over Mission Peak then run down to the gate at Calaveras Road and back (about 15 miles total), but at the point where I'd start running toward Calaveras I decided to cut it short. Mimi and Pop are coming into town, and we're going to decorate the tree with them and Kanta. Also I needed to do some yardwork and hang the Christmas lights, so I didn't want to be totally zonked out. Anyhow, those are my excuses for cutting it short!

Here's the route:

Arti and I went to Zombie Runner last night to pick up a new pair of shoes -- I ended up getting a pair of [Altra Running Superior](http://www.zombierunner.com/store/brands/altra_running/product4349.html) shoes to try out. I've enjoyed the Minimus that I've been running in, but mine are about a half size too short and I was going to experiment with something with a little more cushion. The Altras in 13 fit the bill. I'm normally 11.5 but running downhill demands some extra toe space. The Altras have a nice roomy toe box, and are made of some really great feeling materials.

Even with the steep downhill of MP, my feet feel great. No signs of blisters anywhere, and my index toes aren't bruised up -- which was the main reason for looking at different shoes.

Just as I started down the trail, my body really perked up and I felt great. It was a beautiful day out there today -- about 70 degrees, sunny, with a cool breeze. With some good music playing, it was one kind of heaven! In that situation I can just run and run...

When I was almost to the bottom, the Parks Department helicopter was circling the peak, and announcing something over the PA. There were two Fremont Police Department SUVs at the bottom. I'm not sure what was going on, but it probably wasn't good.
