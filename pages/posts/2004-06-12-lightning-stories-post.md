Here are two stories for the archives....

Sometime in 1995 when I was living on Orange Ave in Costa Mesa
with Ryan and Mike, I witnessed  a great lightning storm.  

It was around 9 or 10PM at the end of a mostly normal, warm, clear
Orange County day.  I can't remember exactly how we first noticed
it -- I think I was coming home from school or work when I saw it
-- but I recall seeing a flurry of lightning activity far in the
distance, in the direction of the ocean.  This lightning didn't
let up -- it was continuous.

We lived on the 2nd (top) floor of a little apartment building, so
we got up on the roof of our place to watch it.  We were up there
for fifteen minutes at least just watching this clump of
continuous lightning when we decided to go find it.

We drove down the 55 freeway to Newport, then turned north up
PCH.  There was just this clump of clouds just off the coast that
was just going nuts with lightning.  We found a place to park near
the sand, and went out onto the beach to watch this thing.

We sat there for a long, long time just watching this amazing
show.  There was a lightning strike at least every second, many
times several at once.  It was silent too -- there was an offshore
breeze, which may have contributed to the lack of noise.

After an hour, we decided to go home.  The lightning cloud had
disapated a bit, and we thought it may be drifting toward us, so
we figured it was time to go home.



The other amazing lightning experience I had happened more
recently.  Arti, my parents, and I went down to Moss Landing an
evening in November 2003 to do a "Full Moon Kayak" excursion.

There are a few Kayak shops in the Moss Landing area, and several
offer nighttime trips when the full moon provides enough light to
navigate.  I had done a similar trip in 1999 or 2000 with Mona and
Musty in Santa Cruz, so I was excited to have another chance to be
out on the water at night.

We paddled out from the harbor at sunset, and slowly made our way out to
the estuary as nighttime made its own slow way over us.  An hour
or so later we were deep in the estuary, surrounded by birds,
fish, and the occasional sea otter poking its head up out of the
water.

Looking east, there were some clouds building up near the hills in
the distance.  From the shape of the clouds, it seemed that there
was a pretty good wind blowing out there.  There were a couple of
occasional lightning strikes as we were paddling out.  Most were
pretty dim, others were bright.

This built up slowly over the course of a half hour or so into an
interesting, sometimes continuous show.

It was a great experience to be in a little boat, sitting on the
surface of the smooth water, not a sound to be heard except for
the sporadic calls of nighttime shorebirds, watching this visually
amazing nature show in the distance reflecting off the water's
surface.
