I got a pair of <a href="http://www.zombierunner.com/store/brands/new_balance/minimalist_shoes/">New Balance Minimus shoes</a> at Zombie Runner this week. Really love how they fit and feel, but I wasn't crazy about the big silver N on each shoe...

So out came the seam ripper and 20 minutes later...

I call this new shoe "Miniminimus".
