My Pops recently put together a <a href="http://s706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Cars-Studebakers/?albumview=slideshow">retrospective of the Studebakers</a> he's bought, sold, and restored over the last decade or so.

While the <a href="http://s706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20and%20Kart/">Kart Hauler</a> has gotten some serious attention and appeared at the Grand National Roadster Show four times now, the black beauty known as "S2D" is still my favorite of all.  Here's an awesome video made with VHS "pause button editing" of that great car...

In Pop's own words "I really enjoyed building that car and I think I really nailed it from an appearance standpoint.  I had a lot of fun with it...drove it over 30,000 miles.  I wish I could keep them all, but since I can't I'm glad it sold it which enabled more adventures with some other cars. [...] Easy launch...even with the locker rear end, those little rear tires would just smoke unless I was easy on the gas/clutch until it was rolling.  Power shifting all gears....right foot on the floor, stab the clutch at 6k and slam the next gear."

Bad-ass.
