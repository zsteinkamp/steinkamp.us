Well, today's the day we pack up our stuff for a three
week trip to India.  We're leaving from SFO late
tonight, flying 15 hours to Hong Kong, a short
layover, then a few hours to Singapore.  12 hours in
Singapore (with a pint sized hotel room), then another
4 hour flight to Bangalore.

You can see our itinerary <a
href=http://calendar.yahoo.com/YYY,abb1bb/srt,0/edsarkiss/?v=2&t=1091347200>here</a>.

We're covering basically the length of the country
during our stay -- starting in the coastal areas of
the south, meeting up with my parents in Mumbai,
heading to Delhi to meet up with Arti's parents, then
travelling north to <a

Pradesh</a> to visit family.

I'm going to disable publishing to the nobot for now,
since I like to keep tabs on things, and I won't be
able to while on the road.

So enjoy your August everyone.  I hope to have lots of
photos and stories to share when we return.
