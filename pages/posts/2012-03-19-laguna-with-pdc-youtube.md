excerpt: |
  Beautiful day today at Laguna. Mid-50s, partly cloudy, snow-capped
  peaks in the distance, dry track. I decided before this event that I'd push
  the car a little harder than normal -- so there's a bit more countersteering
  in this video than others. \n\nManaged to pull out a couple 1:46 laps (a new
  personal best), then had a front swaybar bracket break at the end of this session.
  I removed the swaybar and went out again -- the car was surprisingly well behaved,
  but a few seconds slower.\n\nE36 M3 daily driver, 245/40-17 R-888s, PF-01 pads
