    Plays a number of contiguous time segments of an audio file simultaneously, with a flexible crossfader control to select which segment(s) you want to hear.
    This allows you to scrub through time of a longer sample, while always playing the sample at 1x speed.

    Len Stepper is a single-note arpeggiator that makes it
    easy to create rhythmic patters with any measure division. Use it in
    conjunction with Key Stepper to reliably create polyrythms and fugues.

  description: |
    A step sequencer that is advanced only via incoming MIDI notes. It supports
    pattern lengths of 1-32 steps, and with configurable pitch, velocity, and
    probability per step. Complex polyrhythms and shifting times are easily
    possible.

  description: |
    Decompose chords across multiple tracks. Add the device to each track you
    want to feed off the chord and set the desired voice/channel. Play a MIDI
    chord into any track containing this device, and its notes will be
    distributed across the tracks sharing the same channel.

  description: |
    This device was inspired by the Vestax Faderboard. It is an odd kind of sampler, with 10 voices to play back a sample at your chosen pitch. The thing that makes it unique is that each voice is played using a dedicated fader, and the sample is triggered when the fader leaves the silent position.

    You can also control voice left/right pan position, loop start and end (with the ability to go backwards!), and trigger all voices to restart playing.

  description: |
    This is a MIDI Effect device that will trigger notes in a fractal pattern. The base fractal shape (in terms of timing between echo taps) can be defined, then number of iterations and iteration scale can be controlled. The kinds of textures you can get out of it are really surprising, and have been inspiring to me. There is a natural beauty and harmony to fractals, which can contribute a more natural feel to your sounds.

    This device is mostly implemented in Javascript in Max For Live. Super fun to make.

  description: |
    This is a MIDI Effect device that will repeat notes, with each repeat delay following the Fibonacci Sequence. You can control the number of repeats, time scale, pitch, and velocity change.

    This was my first Javascript-based M4L patch. It was a great learning experience to figure out how to code up both the logic and visualization in M4L's Javascript environment.

    This effect rack device is two independent effects channels (chains) that
    have complete feedback capability, both per-channel and between channels!
    You can put any effects in either chain, and experiment with feedback and
    cross-feedback.
